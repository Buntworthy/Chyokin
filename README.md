# Chyokin

## Chyokin is an app to help you save

Small acts of willpower help you save a little bit at a time: not buying that coffee, choosing a cheaper option, or finding a better deal. All these virtuous actions costs will power, and dnfortunately the payoff you get is often under appreciated.

Chyokin helps you keep track of how much you save (and when you waste), to see the pay off as you save towards a goal.
